# Coordina

In my working life, I often have the need to organise a meeting via Microsoft Teams or Email. The problem is that it is sometimes a nightmare to organise an on-site or online meeting with people in Chat or e-mail for the next period. 
I can see the calendars of internal employees only if they are available, I can request the most suitable calendars from the parties with various applications. But these solutions do not solve the real problem.
Everyone has their own agenda. There are times they do not enter the calendar, times they would prefer. Similarly, the plans and organisations of people outside the company are always very different.
This means that the person who has the responsibility to organise the meeting has to run after everyone to organise the meeting. So which situations often happen?

1. You try to find a suitable time zone in your calendars to find a common time for everyone.
2. You share the optional calendars you have found via e-mail or chat.
3. At that moment, internal employees say that they have other plans for that calendar and that they prefer before or after noon.
4. You go back to the beginning again. You find the most suitable calendar and notify external people.
5. The people outside the company evaluate it internally and convey their most suitable ones. They ask if you can organise accordingly.
6. Of course, some time passes, you run after people to organise a meeting again.
7. Since asynchronous returns are received, you have to wait for everyone's common answer.
8. While you are following your normal business, you are suddenly faced with the stress of organising such a meeting. You try to get their feedback by making polite reminders to the relevant parties.
9. In the end, you try to find a schedule that everyone will be happy with and organise the meeting.
10. 2 days before the meeting, you get the sentence ‘Can we postpone the meeting for a week?’.
11. You go back to the first item.

I will prepare a solution that can solve this problem with LLM and Agentic AI. I just need you to organise a one-hour meeting with me next week with these people. Periodically monitor the environments you correspond with until the meeting time passes. Suggest people according to their convenient times, get the most suitable calendar, correspond with people outside the company. Comment on their returns, give gentle reminders to those who do not return. If you are stuck on a subject you cannot decide, ask me and I will guide you. Organise the meeting. Follow the process until the time of the meeting. End this task when the meeting time passes.
